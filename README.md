# DegenWallet.py
This is a little collection of code snippets to prepare Ethereum transaction payload.
The set of commands in this script are prepared to intereface the legacy Gnosis Wallet that does not have UI support anymore (the version on GitHub is broken since EIP1559 activation).

## Usage
1. Uncomment and modify the desired sections in the `DegenWallet.py` file
2. Get an infura project ID, e.g. `e68eab41f9f74d4287e74f038d1ae5bf`
3. Start via `python DegenWallet.py e68eab41f9f74d4287e74f038d1ae5bf`
